        </a>What is On Point?

      </h3>

      <p>

		On Point is a definitive resource to ensure that manufacturers have access to a highly skilled resource, ACT's
        National Career Readiness Certificate (NCRC). Under the auspices of Nevada Industry Excellence (NVIE), On Point
        is an effort associated with the Nevada Manufacturing Sector Council, striving to motivate a minimum of 40
        manufacturers in Nevada to utilize the NCRC as a tool to hire a skilled workforce or promote from within by
        the end of 2015.

		  <br/>
		  <br/>

		  Nevada’s manufacturing industry faces the problem of identifying and recruiting well versed qualified
		  employees. The ACT National Career Readiness Certificate (NCRC) is able to determine if a potential employee
		  is capable of the needed manufacturing skills that leaders are currently searching for. The ACT NCRC is used
		  to evaluate a person’s core problem-solving abilities. The ACT NCRC evaluates its users by giving a bronze,
		  silver, gold, or platinum certificate based on scores obtained through the NCRC WorkKeys® Assessments.
		  At this point in time, the leaders of the manufacturing industry are not using the ACT NCRC due to a lack
		  of awareness for this powerful tool. On Point is a mobile application that will educate manufacturing leaders
		  and encourage the use of the ACT NCRC.

		<br/>
		<br/>

		 On Point’s primary goal is to make the ACT NCRC an industry standard for determining an employee's skills and
		  abilities; thus, allowing industry leaders to effectively evaluate potential employee skills and ability to
		  learn. On Point will inform Nevada’s manufacturing industry of the benefits that the NCRC has to offer.
		  On Point will provide many useful tools such as practice tests and exam scheduling assistance that will
		  benefit the Nevada manufacturing industry as a whole.
